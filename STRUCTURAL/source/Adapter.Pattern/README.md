#Adapter Pattern
The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. 
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interface.

- Allows a client with an incompatible interface to be used by creating an Adapter that does the conversion.
- It decouples the client from the implemented interface. 
- The client doesn't have to be modified each time it needs to operate againts a different interface as the adapter is encapsulated.
